# Laravel+AdminLTE3: Adminpanel Boilerplate

It is a demo project for demonstrating what can be generated with new 2019 version of [QuickAdminPanel](https://2019.quickadminpanel.com) tool. This boilerplate was fully __generated__, without adding any custom line of code.

## What's inside

- Adminpanel with default one admin user (_admin@admin.com/password_) and two roles
- Users/Roles/permissions management function (based on our own code similar to Spatie Roles-Permissions)
- One demo CRUD for Products management - name/description/price
- Everything that is needed for CRUDs: model+migration+controller+requests+views

From that boilerplate you can manually create more CRUDs, assign permissions etc. Or use our [online generator](https://2019.quickadminpanel.com) for this.

__Notice__: AdminLTE 3 version was not released officially. At the time of writing (April 2019), the latest was [v3.0.0-Alpha 2 release in May 2018](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.2). But, at current alpha state, the theme is good enough to use for simple CRUDs like ours.
